**SONA by IONE --- Jude Pastor Prototype Plan (2025--2026)**

**Core Concept**

***SONA is a live music app where artists can perform, fans can watch,
and everyone can connect --- simply, beautifully, and fairly.***

**The first version will be built for one artist --- Jude Pastor --- so
we can prove that one real musician can earn, grow, and manage his music
life in one app.**

**SONA earns small percentages per action; it grows with the artists.**

2.  **At least 100 viewers join from his socials.**

3.  **10% of viewers send tips.**

**If those happen, SONA is validated.**

**SONA's MVP SCREENS (in order)**

2.  **Watch --- stream + tip + chat**

3.  **Go Live --- setup + camera + setlist**

4.  **Profile --- artist info + events + badge**

5.  **Create --- upload clip, event, or moment**

6.  **Payment sheet --- tipping popup**

7.  **Admin (for you) --- list of users, streams, and tips**

**DESIGN MANTRA**

- **Apple-level simplicity: black, white, soft gradients, motion synced
  to sound.**

- **Sound = center of gravity. No clutter, no feed spam.**

- **Addiction through rhythm: autoplay next clip, micro-haptics,
  emotional feedback.**

**WHY THIS PLAN WORKS**

- **Jude gives credibility, content, and organic marketing.**

- **You build something *useful*, not theoretical.**

- **You learn to code with clear purpose --- every function connects to
  a real artist workflow.**

- **It scales naturally: one artist → local network → full scene.**
